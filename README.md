### General Info

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this project, the challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

The **Employee Tracker** focusses on getting the basic functionality and allows the user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees.
